## 🧠 How It Works

- The website is fully static (no backend).  
- Dark mode toggles via the ☀️ / 🌙 button and uses `localStorage` to remember the user’s choice.  
- The mobile navigation slides out from the **right side** when the hamburger menu is clicked.  
- Projects are defined in a JavaScript object and displayed dynamically in modal popups.  
- The contact form opens your email client automatically using a `mailto:` link.
